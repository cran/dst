dst v1.0.0 (Estimated release date: 2018-04-26)

Many changes and new functions added.
=================
Changes from version 0.3:
- Added a vignette: The Monty hall Game, an introduction to belief functions.

- functions (new and updated):

-- addTobca: New function. Adds some elements of 0 mass to an existing mass function.

-- bca: New version. Sets a class named "bcaspec". Parameters added to work with definitions on product spaces (relations).

-- bcaRel: New function to define a belief function on a product space.

-- belplau: Calculation of measures of belief, plausibility and ratio of plausibility.

-- decode: utility function
-- dotprod: utility function
-- double: utility function
-- shape: utility function
-- encode: New utility function. Convert a value to its representation in another chosen base.
-- reduction: utility function to obtain the summary of a vector for any operator

-- dsrwon: Combination of two mass functions

-- elim: This is a new function. This function works on a relation defined on a product of two variables or more.  Having fixed a variable to eliminate from the relation,  the reduced product space is determined and the corresponding reduced bca is computed.This operation is also called "marginalization".

-- extmin: Extension of a relation to a greater product space

-- inters: Intersection of two tables of propositions

-- nameRows: New function: Using the column names of a matrix to construct names for the rows

-- nzdsr: Normalization of results from Dempster's rule of combination.

-- productSpace: New function. Product space representation of a relation

-- plautrans:Plausibility transformation of the singletons of a frame

-- tabresul:  Prepare a table of results.

- Removal of obsolete functions:
butLast, combmasses, dempster, initsing, rplau, transfo
