dst 1.4.0 (2019-08-11)
- Correction to fn extmin: Added a test for variable names missing.

- Correction to productSpace function. Transpose of array removed at the end of the function.
================
dst v 1.3.0 (on CRAN 2018-12-05)
- added utility functions 'matrixToMarray' and 'marrayToMatrix' to execute the product space conversion of multidimensional data represented by a matrix, and vice-versa.

- debugging of function 'extmin' (extension of data to a larger product space).

- debugging of function 'elim' (reduction of a product space by elimination of one variable).

================
dst v1.2.0.9001
2018-07-07. 
- Correction to fn dsrwon: added the parameter relnb in the call of the function, to allow for specification the result with a new relation number.

================
dst v1.2.0.9000
2018-05-01. 
- Correction to fn tabresul: added a check for the case of the empty set present with m_empty = 0

================
dst v1.1.0.9000
2018-05-01. 
- Correction to fn belplau: added a check for the case of the empty set present with m_empty = 0
- Re-writed the referencing of source code taken on Rpubs

================
dst v1.0.0 (Release date on CRAN: 2018-04-25)

Changes from version 0.3:
- Added a vignette: The Monty hall Game, an introduction to belief functions.

- functions (new and updated):

-- addTobca: New function. Adds some elements of 0 mass to an existing mass function.

-- bca: New version. Sets a class named "bcaspec". Parameters added to work with definitions on product spaces (relations).

-- bcaRel: New function to define a belief function on a product space.

-- belplau: Calculation of measures of belief, plausibility and ratio of plausibility.

-- decode: utility function
-- dotprod: utility function
-- double: utility function
-- shape: utility function
-- encode: New utility function. Convert a value to its representation in another chosen base.
-- reduction: utility function to obtain the summary of a vector for any operator

-- dsrwon: Combination of two mass functions

-- elim: This is a new function. This function works on a relation defined on a product of two variables or more.  Having fixed a variable to eliminate from the relation,  the reduced product space is determined and the corresponding reduced bca is computed.This operation is also called "marginalization".

-- extmin: Extension of a relation to a greater product space

-- inters: Intersection of two tables of propositions

-- nameRows: New function: Using the column names of a matrix to construct names for the rows

-- nzdsr: Normalization of results from Dempster's rule of combination.

-- productSpace: New function. Product space representation of a relation

-- plautrans:Plausibility transformation of the singletons of a frame

-- tabresul:  Prepare a table of results.

- Removal of obsolete functions:
butLast, combmasses, dempster, initsing, rplau, transfo

dst v0.3: Initial release of package on CRAN (2015-01-13)
