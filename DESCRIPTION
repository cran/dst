Description: Using the Theory of Belief Functions for evidence calculus. Basic probability assignments, or mass functions, can be defined on the subsets of a set of possible values and combined. A mass function can be extended to a larger frame. Marginalization, i.e. reduction to a smaller frame can also be done. These features can be combined to analyze small belief networks and take into account situations where information cannot be satisfactorily described by probability distributions.
